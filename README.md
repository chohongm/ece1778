# [ECE1778](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece1778/) Fall 2016 - Creative Apps For Mobile Devices.
Finally it's time to get my hands dirty with Android. I always wanted to but could not invest time. Now is the opportunity.

## Experience So Far:
Looks like Android was patched up with a duct tape. Why do we need to complicate things so much with so many shitty things. To add to that I have never worked on JAVA language ever before, this is the first time I am writing any JAVA code. The experience so far: Java is painful

*Even after declaring everything we intend to have, the code still runs into null pointer exceptions. What's the point?*

## Class Assignments:
- [Assignment 1](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece1778/assignmentp1.pdf)
- [Assignment 2](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece1778/assignmentp2.pdf)
- [Assignment 3](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece1778/assignmentp3.pdf)
- [Assignment 4](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece1778/assignmentp4.pdf)

## Some cool things I learnt and implemented:

- Assignment 1:

    - [This haptic feedback button](https://github.com/whizzzkid/ece1778/blob/master/Assignment1/app/src/main/java/in/nishantarora/assignment1/MainActivity.java#L25). This enables haptic feedback on any button you implment. For some reason this is the only way I could make this work.

- Assignment 2:

    - [This List](https://github.com/whizzzkid/ece1778/blob/master/Assignment2/app/src/main/java/in/nishantarora/assignment2/MovieList.java#L49). You can use this to implement lists like the one found in Google Keep.
   
- Assignment 3:
    
    - [This Delete Method](https://github.com/whizzzkid/ece1778/blob/master/Assignment3/app/src/main/java/in/nishantarora/assignment3/ImageFragment.java#L86). Using ContentResolver is so cool, it can do plenty of stuff.
    - [This Location Getter](https://github.com/whizzzkid/ece1778/blob/master/Assignment3/app/src/main/java/in/nishantarora/assignment3/MainActivityFragment.java#L128) Using alternate locations for faster processing.
    - [This GeoTagging](https://github.com/whizzzkid/ece1778/blob/master/Assignment3/app/src/main/java/in/nishantarora/assignment3/MainActivityFragment.java#L150) Adding locations to your images fast.

- Assignment 4

    - [This Thread Manager](https://github.com/whizzzkid/ece1778/blob/master/Assignment4/app/src/main/java/in/nishantarora/assignment4/ImportFragment.java#L136) Ideally I should've used `ThreadPoolExecuter` but that shit was too complicated for me to run in time for the assignment. This assignment goes as is.
